							<h2>Our meaning</h2>
								<p>We wanted a company name that reflected a piece of Canadian history itself.&nbsp;</p>
							  <p>The region of Acadia, now known as Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, New Brunswick, Gaspésie, and parts of Maine, were the landing grounds for immigrants to Canada from as far back as the 17th century. The British North America Act created the Dominion of Canada on July 1st, 1867.&nbsp;</p>
							  <p>During the Seven Years' War, Acadia was a New-France colony which claimed to be neutral in war, however and in spite of everything, a 'Great Expulsion' was carried out between 1755 and 1764 where Acadians were relocated by British forces for military purposes. Many Acadians perished.&nbsp;</p>
							  <p>Through their resiliency, Acadians returned and still live in the regions of Acadia today and many Canadians have Acadian background in their blood - including Acadia Engineering Inc. founders.&nbsp;</p>
							  <p>Our logo incorporates the Maple Leaf emblem to show our Canadian identity. A blue surveying tripod level is worked into the 'A' to represent our steadfast dedication to civil engineering.</p>
